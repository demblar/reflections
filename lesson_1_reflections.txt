it is good to have version control

you could see your errors and development and then at the end to see your weakpoints.

the benefits of manual commit is that you have the freedom to push commit when you think it is the best moment
knowing the specifics of your code and changes. The negative site is that sometimes, drown into writing code, you
just forget to do it, where automatical commit would be quite useful.

Git probably allows multiple files tracking due to the fact it is mostly used in applications for developing software
libraries, etc. Where google docs is mostly to track changes in projects consisting of one file.

Using git log it will show the different commits with the tile of the commit. Then using the diff command you
can compare the revissions and have a clear view of what was added and what deleted.

Well, having a version control and being able to jump back and forth between different commits definitely gives you a peace of mind, knowing that anything can be reverted easily.

I would like to use git for version control and commits
