When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to access it from multiple computers and / or contribute with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would not always want to merge your current local repository with the remote one especually when multiple
developers contribute on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
1) Forking make a clone on GitHub
2) Clones are on the local repository
3) Brances are clone one onto the same project


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can use it to fetch latest changes and merge only then.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
we would probably comunicate with txt docs with describes on changes, however it will be very hard to
actually track done changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

Considering the workflow in GitHub if you push changes directly to the master branch there would be no way
to check if there won't be conflicts or if the update would break the current release so it is better to do
all that in a seaprate branch.

Working in the master directly would save time.
