What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates a metadata folder .git that tracks your commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place that holds file from the working directory that would be pushed to repository in the next commit.
If you think multiple files are logically linked it will be wise to include them all in 1 commit thus placing them
in the staging area until all files are ready to be commited.
